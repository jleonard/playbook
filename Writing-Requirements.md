#Writing Requirements

##The Benefits of Documenting Requirements

* Fewer meetings
* More accurate estimates from developers
* It's the fastest way to describe page functionality
* Better project artifacts

A wireframe or visual design without written requirements is only a drawing of a website.  Without requirements, those drawings are open to interpretation by your clients and fellow team members. Bad interpretation leads to late nights, lost profits and unhappy everybody. Nail that shit down.

##How to write requirements

* Write a sentence for each piece of functionality on the page.
* The subject of each sentence will typically be either ***User*** or ***System***.

####Examples
> * System will present User with a map showing <= 10 of the User's friends in the immediate area.
* System will limit the zoom level of the map to 1 mile.
* System will display a "no friends nearby" message if 0 friends are found within a 1 mile proximity to the user.
