#Git Workflow
> Inspired by Vincent Driessen's [git-flow branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)

####Branches
* **feature branches** - used for active development. The naming convention is ``feature/FEATURE_NAME``  
* **bugfix branches** - quick fixes off of master. The naming convention ``bug/BUG_NAME``  
* **experiment branches** - used for experiments during development. The naming convention is ``experiment/EXPERIMENT_NAME``  
* **master** - the central branch of the repository. 

####Tags  
> Tags are used to mark points in time during development.

* **release tags** use the naming convention ``release/VERSION_NUMBER``  
* **review tags** use the naming convention ``review/REVIEW_DATE``
